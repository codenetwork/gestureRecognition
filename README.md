# GestureRecognition

A Code Network **Gesture Recognition Software** project implemented in **Python** for recognizing and classifying hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## üìå Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection using OpenCV.
- Machine learning model for gesture classification.
- Custom dataset creation for training.
- Live visualization of recognized gestures.
- Modular and extensible architecture.


## üöÄ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codenetwork/gestureRecognition.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
### Running Gesture Recognition
Run the main script to start recognizing gestures in real-time:
```bash
python src/gesture_recog.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision)
- **MediaPipe** (Hand Tracking)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Machine Learning Model)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (Data Handling)

## üß™ Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Capturing hand gestures using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting key hand landmarks.
3. **Model Training**: Using a neural network to classify gestures.
4. **Real-time Prediction**: Integrating the trained model for live recognition.

## üåü If You Are Interested
If you have the following skills or if you are simply looking to learn, here's how you can contribute:
- **Python Basics**: If you're learning Python, start by looking at simple scripts and trying to understand how they work. You can help by cleaning up code, adding comments, or fixing small issues.
- **Working with OpenCV**: If you're interested in computer vision, try running the project and experimenting with small changes, enhance gesture detection, fine-tune landmark tracking, or add new recognition features..
- **Machine Learning**: Learn about leveraging certain machine learning models. Help improve the model accuracy, experiment with the model architecture, optimize performance, or identify alternative methodologies.
- **Testing & Debugging**: Run the project, see if you encounter any issues, and report them. Even better, try to find small bugs and suggest fixes.
- **Documentation**: Improving explanations in the README, adding beginner-friendly guides, or fixing typos can be a huge help.

Feel free to contribute and enhance this project!
